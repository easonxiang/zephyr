The Unisoc SDKs provides device header files and driver libraries for the
Unisoc UWP3 SoCs.

In order to use UWP SDKs, drivers and applications need to

1. Set CONFIG_HAS_UWP360=y in Kconfig
2. Include driver/include/uwp360_hal.h 

After above operations, all of the peripheral driver library functions will
be accessible.
